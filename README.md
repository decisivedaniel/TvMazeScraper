# TvMazeScraper

![Current Build](https://github.com/decisivedaniel/TvMazeScraper/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg?event=merge)

Started creating the controller based TVMaze API with the built in template given by dotnet. Some consideration was given to creating a minimal API as that would be more suited to respond better to event driven development as simple lambda functions. However, with the needed functionality of scraping the TVMaze database felt the original controller based approach would give me the most options before refactoring at a later time to a more scaliable version.
